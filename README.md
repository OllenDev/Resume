# Resume
My resume as an Android phone.

## AI Tools Experiment
Using this little project to test out just how far I can get on the $20 OpenAI subscription with Codex. I'm also using the free Github Actions and free Github Codespaces to build this entirely in the cloud. When I've got a few spare minutes I'm prompting Codex and seeing if I can guide it to build this like I want with minimal instructions.
